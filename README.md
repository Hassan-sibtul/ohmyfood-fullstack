OhMyFood - Fullstack Starter

This package contains a starter full-stack project built from your existing front-end assets.

Folders:

- server: Node/Express backend (models, routes, seed)
- client: React frontend (skeleton - use create-react-app or paste into an existing CRA project)

Quickstart:

1. Server:
   cd server
   npm install
   copy .env.example to .env and edit (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET)
   npm run seed # (optional) seed sample data
   npm run dev

2. Client:
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start

The client expects the API at http://localhost:5000/api by default.

You can now adapt the React components and styles with your original HTML/CSS.
